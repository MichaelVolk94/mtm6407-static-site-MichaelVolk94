<h1>About Me</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>My name is Michael Volk. I am a 24 year old student from Ottawa, Ontario who currently
    attends Algonquin College in the Interactive Media & Design program. I have excellent
    attention to detail skills and I'm extremely hard working.</p>
<h2>My Skills</h2>
<p>I have skills with photography, drawing, and detailing. I also love making videos and photo books of my trips.</p>
<h2>My Journey</h2>
<p>My journey wasn't easy. I was born at the Civic Hospital on October 22, 2001. 
  I grew up in the Nepean area, first on Carleton Heights, and I moved to the Pineglen area in 2008. 
</p>
<p>In 2005, I was diagnosed with ASD at the age of 3. A disability so severe to the point
  I have extreme anxiety. It was noticable when I was a little boy whenever she's away, I would
  always have extreme anxiety, so she prepared little by little to the point I wasn't ready for the big step of kindergarten until I was 
almost 5. years old. Mom said I was nonverbal until I was almost 4 and a half years old.
Elementary school was very difficult. My anxiety was very high, I was easily frustrated, and I cried a lot.
Some teachers were not very patient and did not always follow my IEP much to mom's annoyance. In 
first grade I made new friends, and we played together at recess. We played a lot of basketball, tag, and 
in the winter, we built snow forts or slid down the hills in the schoolyard. My favorite class was gym.
My least favorite subjects were reading and math. These are still my least favorite classes to this day. In 
grade four I had a wonderful teacher who taught me how to create videos on the computer. I still make 
videos in my spare time as a hobby.
</p>
<p>
After elementary school, I went to Frank Ryan Senior Elementary School. I spent two wonderful years 
there. I was a much happier boy there, and as a result my anxiety levels dropped considerably. While 
there I discovered a love for music. My music teacher opened up the music room at lunch after he found 
me playing around on the piano. I was playing tunes without notes, and completely by ear. He later 
began a ukulele club during my lunch hour. I learned that music helps me relax and reduces my stress 
levels. This love of music continued through High School.
</p>
<p>
I started attending St Pius X High School from 2016 to 2021. While in high school I completed seven 
music credits. I learned to play the guitar and bass clarinet. In grade nine I signed up for a graphic design
type computer class and I loved it. I continued taking these classes until it was no longer offered when I 
was in grade 12 due to low enrollment. I love designing and drawing things on the computer. This gives
me a great deal of confidence. 
</p>
<p>How I got into photography was during my first semester of college. I began to learn the basics of professional 
  photography, which led to me getting hooked, and turned it into a hobby. That's where Michael Volk's Photography 
  Studio was born. This business is dedicated to my passion to photography where my customers would always come back for more.
We sell camera equipment, photography class sessions, and of course photos! My job is to create the best experience for not just photographers, 
but people starting out. If you ever want to start making photos in a professional manner, then Michael Volk's Photography Studio is the right place for you!</p>
